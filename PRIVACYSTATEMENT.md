### B. Operational Data  
| **Data Type**               | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Retention**       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Device Information<br>(e.g., OS) | Monitor SDK performance, diagnose errors, and improve reliability.          | 6 months            |
| Anonymized Usage Metrics<br>(e.g., feature adoption rates) | Optimize resource allocation and service quality.                            | Aggregated indefinitely |

**Note:**  
- Audio/text data is processed in real-time and **not stored** after session completion.
