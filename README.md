## 😎 What is Duix Mobile?

Duix Mobile is an open-source SDK developed by [www.duix.com](http://www.duix.com) that enables developers to create real-time interactive AI avatars directly on **mobile devices** or **embedded screens**. It is designed for on-device deployment, with no dependency on cloud servers, making it lightweight, private, and highly responsive.

Duix Mobile supports one-click cross-platform deployment (Android/iOS), has a low learning curve, and is suitable for various application scenarios such as intelligent customer service, virtual doctors, virtual lawyers, virtual companions, and virtual tutors.
